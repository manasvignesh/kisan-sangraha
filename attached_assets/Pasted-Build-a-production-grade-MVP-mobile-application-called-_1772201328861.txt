Build a production-grade MVP mobile application called “Kisan ColdChain” that helps small and marginal farmers discover, compare, and book nearby cold storage facilities in a transparent and efficient manner to reduce post-harvest losses and improve selling decisions.

The app must directly address the core challenges: lack of visibility into storage capacity, unclear pricing, informal booking processes, poor coordination between farmers and storage providers, and limited access to market and weather insights.

The product should feel like a deployable real-world solution, not a prototype. Focus on intuitive usability, transparency, and decision support for farmers in rural and low-connectivity environments.

## PRIMARY USERS

1. Farmers (main users)
2. Cold Storage Owners / Providers (secondary dashboard)

## CORE NAVIGATION STRUCTURE

Bottom navigation with four tabs:
Home | My Bookings | Insights | Profile

Each tab must be fully functional and populated with meaningful content.

## HOME DASHBOARD (Farmer View)

The dashboard should follow this vertical structure:

1. Compact weekly calendar strip showing current date
2. Weather advisory card with temperature and simple storage suggestion
3. Nearby Cold Storage Facilities section displaying interactive cards

Each storage card must include:

* Storage name
* Location and distance
* Storage type tags (Cold / Frozen / Dairy)
* Price per kg per day
* Real-time available capacity
* Trust badge (Govt Verified / Certified)
* Rating score
* Primary CTA: “View & Book”

Availability must be color-coded:
Green = high availability
Orange = medium
Red = low capacity
